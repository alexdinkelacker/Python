Here is a project that displays Pythons powerful ability to do image processing and an ode to Guido. 
If you run this code, it does take a while to fully run through all the code. 
However, you will be left with several pictures that have all been altered in some way. 
You will know when the code is finished when Guidos face comes up on the screen as the classic Warhol image.
Enjoy!
